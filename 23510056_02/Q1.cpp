// Q.1 You are an IT company's manager. Based on their performance over the last N working days, you
// must rate your employee. You are given an array of N integers called workload, where workload[i]
// represents the number of hours an employee worked on an i
// th day. The employee must be evaluated
// using the following criteria:
// âˆ™ Rating = the maximum number of consecutive working days when the employee has worked
// more than 6 hours.
// You are given an integer N where N represents the number of working days. You are given an integer
// array workload where workload[i] represents the number of hours an employee worked on an i
// th day.
// Task
// Determine the employee rating
